In the ASVspoof2021 DF dataset, synthesizer methods are divided into five categories: neural vocoder autoregressive (AR), neural vocoder non-autoregressive (NAR), traditional vocoder (TRD), waveform concatenation (CONC), and unknown (UNK). We use only a subset of fake samples in the test subset of the ASVspoof2021 DF dataset. Specifically, the number of fake samples in each synthesizer category is matched to the number of real samples in the test subset.
